# Mean Squared Error

Commonly used metric to evaluate the performance of regresion models. <br />
Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.

- \( n \) is the number of data points (observations).
- \( y_i \) is the actual value for the \(i\)th data point.
- \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value for the \(i\)th data point.
- \( (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \) represents the squared difference between the actual and predicted values.

$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$
